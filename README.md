# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CodePipeline
----
This repo includes the Terraform module and CloudFormation source code for setup infrastructure pipeline on AWS using AWS CodePipeline. 
This idea comes from the CI/CD pipeline. We will adopt Infrastructure as Code and treat as Software. Before we creating actual resources on AWS, we have to pre-configure git repository and pipeline for those resources. This repo will help you create and configure your infrastructure pipeline and deploy it automatically.

Terraform registry url for code pipeline module: https://registry.terraform.io/modules/DTherHtun/codepipeline
